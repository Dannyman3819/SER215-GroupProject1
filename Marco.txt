Guys,
to implement the dictionary, place the files I uploaded in the “Dictionary files” folder in the src directory of the project, create a variable of the “HangDictionary” class, and call the .getWordFromFile() or the .getWordFromList() method to get the word for the game.

Please go over the code and let me know if I can modify anything to make it better.
